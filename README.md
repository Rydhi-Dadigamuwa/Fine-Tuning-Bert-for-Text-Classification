# BERT-Text-Classification

## This repository contains two Jupyter Notebooks that demonstrate text classification using BERT by fine-tuning. The notebooks included are:

* IMDB Review Analysis
* SMS Spam Classifier
<br />

## IMDB Review Analysis
This notebook demonstrates how to classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. It leverages BERT's capabilities by fine-tuning it on the IMDB dataset.
<br />

## SMS Spam Classifier
This notebook shows how to classify SMS messages as spam or ham (not spam). The model is fine-tuned on a dataset of SMS messages to accurately detect spam messages.
<br />
## Setup
Recomended to run on google colab
